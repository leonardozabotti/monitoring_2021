#let's now import a .csv file already present in the WD

covid <- read.table("covid_agg.csv", header=TRUE)     #header means that the table already has an header so the fist line is not data
covid

# Now let's see the density of covid data!

# the function we are going to use is \ppp\ to make a Planar Point Pattern 
help(ppp)     # to see parameters

# before going on, since we'll use just one dataset is better to \attach()\ it

attach(covid)

# let's now use \ppp(x, y, x.range, y.range,)\ . If you don't remember the names of variables just put \names(covid)\

covid_planar <- ppp(lon, lat, c(-180,180), c(-90, 90))   # the ranges are the ranges of Earth's longitude and latitude; in general the range of coordinates are the range of the final map that we want to obtain or just increase a bit the range present in the dataset

#once the planar point pattern is created we can create a map using the \density()\ function that uses the covid ppp

density_map <- density(covid_planar)
plot(dens_map)      #shows the map obtained in the ranges selected

#if we want to put points on top of our map we can:
points(covid_planar)

 # \colorRampPalette()\ changes the colours of the range in the map according to density. Colours are important ("The misure of coulour in science communications" check paper on Nature)
 
cl <- colorRampPalette(c('yellow', 'orange', 'red'))(100)      #the number (100) means that in between colours we want 100 shades; order of colours are from lower to higher value; check colours in R on Google
plot(dens_map, col = cl)
points(covid_planar)

# we are now ready to put country border on the map using another package which is \rgdal\ that uses a library of geospatial data abstraction open source made from osgeo.org

#download ne_10m coastline file from VIRTUALE  and put them in the WD; .shp file has info about spatial distribution, .dbf has the dataset related to coordinates, .shx has indexes connecting spatian data to dataset

# we can now add the coaslines on the density map already plotted
plot(density_map, col = cl)

# how to export maps? just by using the "export" button on the R Studio interface or using the command \png()\ or the command \pdf()\

png("figure1.png")       #now we can list all the images we'd like to export in the WD

## INTERPOLATION

cases_map <- Smooth(covid_planar)        # \Smooth()\ is the function to create interpolation

plot(cases_map)       #just to see a draft of the map

plot(cases_map, col=cl)
plot(coastlines, add=T)      # REMEMBER TO PUT add=T
points(covid_planar, pch=19, cex=0.2)
