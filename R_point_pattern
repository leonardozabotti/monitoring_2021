covid

# Now let's see the density of covid data!

# the function we are going to use is \ppp\ to make a Planar Point Pattern 
help(ppp)     # to see parameters

# before going on, since we'll use just one dataset is better to \attach()\ it

attach(covid)

# let's now use \ppp(x, y, x.range, y.range,)\ . If you don't remember the names of variables just put \names(covid)\

covid_planar <- ppp(lon, lat, c(-180,180), c(-90, 90))   # the ranges are the ranges of Earth's longitude and latitude; in general the range of coordinates are the range of the final map that we want to obtain or just increase a bit the range present in the dataset

#once the planar point pattern is created we can create a map using the \density()\ function that uses the covid ppp

density_map <- density(covid_planar)
plot(dens_map)      #shows the map obtained in the ranges selected

#if we want to put points on top of our map we can:
points(covid_planar)

 # \colorRampPalette()\ changes the colours of the range in the map according to density. Colours are important ("The misure of coulour in science communications" check paper on Nature)

plot(dens_map, col = cl)
