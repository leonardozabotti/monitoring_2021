####        multivar: object on which we associate ellipses
####                  type: this argument states the column of the file "biomes_types" we will use
####                        col: we choose the colours of the ellipses
####                                                             kind: just states what kind of ellipse we want. \ehull\ means the ellipse shoudl enclose all of the plots

#now we want to include the biomes names in the graphic otherwise we can't know which ellipse refere to each biome
ordispider(multivar, type, col=c("black","red","green","blue"), label = T)        #creates a network connecting all the plots of the DCA refferring to the same biome
####                                                            label=T means that it will show the biomes type
